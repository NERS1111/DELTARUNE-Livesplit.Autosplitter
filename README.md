# DELTARUNE-Livesplit.Autosplitter
Autosplitter for DELTARUNE (SURVEY_PROGRAM, 1.08, 1.09, 1.10, 1.15).

Inspired by [Narry's Autosplitter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SCpuUpDgIYHmbc6xKK3ZrNk1zaIeDUMq/view?usp=sharing) based on Glacia's Undertale autosplitter (But I don't understand everything so I made my own)

**Auto end-splitting may not be frame-perfectly accurate**

# Splits
There is a lot of additional splits possible like after skips that normally aren't in standard splits because if I made a autosplitter it's to split the most possible segments as possible.

## Currently available
- Chapter 1 (any%, TP, TR)
- Chapter 2 (Main Route, All Recruits) -- **Need manual split for Mecha Queen**
- All Chapters (Main Route)
