# DELTARUNE-Livesplit.Autosplitter
Autosplitter for DELTARUNE (version 1.07).

Inspired by [Narry's Autosplitter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SCpuUpDgIYHmbc6xKK3ZrNk1zaIeDUMq/view?usp=sharing) based on Glacia's Undertale autosplitter (But I don't understand everything so I made my own)

**CURRENTLY IN DEV, NOT FINISHED**

# Splits
There is a lot of additional splits possible like after skips that normally aren't in standart splits because if I made a autosplitter it's to split the most possible segments as possible.
