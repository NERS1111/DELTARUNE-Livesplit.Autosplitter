# DELTARUNE-Livesplit.Autosplitter
Autosplitter for DELTARUNE (SURVEY_PROGRAM, 1.08 to 1.10, 1.15)

Inspired by [Narry's Autosplitter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SCpuUpDgIYHmbc6xKK3ZrNk1zaIeDUMq/view?usp=sharing) based on Glacia's Undertale autosplitter (But I don't understand everything so I made my own)

**Auto end-splitting may not be frame-perfectly accurate**

Don't forget to configure your settings before using it.
